# üîÆ Future Improvements 

- [ ] We can store the images using `multer`.  
- [ ] Optimize image upload using cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary).  
- [ ] Make sure the validation of the data sent by the user through `req.body` before working on it. 
- [ ] Conversion of the data fields to their correct format type from string like ids, dates, Array, integer, etc.  
- [ ] Add authentication & role-based access control (admin, user).  
- [ ] Implement search & filter for events (by date, location, category).    
- [ ] Improve error handling and validation.
